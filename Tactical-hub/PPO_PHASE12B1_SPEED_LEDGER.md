# Tactical-hub PPO Phase 12B-1 Speed Ledger

Updated: 2026-09-28

## Goal and fixed semantics
- Original 50k wall: ~1131.09 sec.
- 20x target: <=56.5545 sec / 50k decisions (~884.1 decisions/sec).
- Keep exactly 8 environments, same-policy collection, one PPO update after 8 episodes.
- Keep round_major_env_index merge order and deterministic resume/update behavior.
- Do not change game rules, Observation/Action semantics, reward, adjudication, PPO loss,
  checkpoint schema, trajectory semantics, seed management, or update/episode counters.

## Current verified baseline
- V5 branch: experiment/ppo-fast-batch-v5-compact-rows
- V5 commit: e0f832b874cc373abb776fd9c221d904f08e37fa
- V5 40k actual wall: 227.197 sec.
- V5 50k ~282.65 sec is projection only, not an actual 50k run.
- V5 stage timings at 40k:
  - batchAct 59.438 sec
  - retention replay 59.382 sec
  - observation encode 36.737 sec
  - game step 34.664 sec
  - action encode 28.380 sec
- V5 exactness: model/optimizer/CPU RNG/CUDA RNG/counters/rollout hashes/workload/
  retention/validation/all-episodes-learnable all PASS.
## Compact Action evidence
- Probe-01: 99.5798% Action zeros; sparse round-trip byte exact.
- Probe-02: direct sparse encoder byte exact; dense encode 1960.009 ms,
  direct sparse encode 1665.775 ms (1.17663x).
- Probe-03A:
  - dense Action bytes 1,012,480
  - sparse Action bytes 5,032
  - raw reduction 99.5030%
  - deflate reduction 65.3853%
  - CPU/GPU restored actions and actionMask exact
  - model outputs exact
  - sampled action/logProbability/value exact
  - CPU RNG and CUDA RNG after sampling exact
  - isolated dense transfer 33.919 ms
  - sparse transfer + GPU restore 16.062 ms (2.11181x)

## Closed / failed routes
- torch.compile: microprobe faster, actual 5k slower; do not retry casually.
- strict multistream: exact but insufficient speedup.
- exact state branch cache: ~1.1x only.
- grouped Replay H2D empty-skip: changed model/optimizer; no-skip exact but replay worsened.
- V4 Node worker pool: exact at 8k but wall worsened 58.253 -> 60.613 sec.
- Do not change 8 env to 16/32 without explicit approval.

## Current experiment
- Branch: experiment/ppo-fast-batch-v6-sparse-action-transport
- Implementation commit: 89c1c7c
- Packing-test commit: 38cf3fd
- Stage A only: sparse Action transport for packedActBatch, retention explicitly disabled.
- Direct sparse Action encoder is NOT integrated yet; current packer scans encoded dense rows.
- Purpose: prove production transport/GPU-restore/model/RNG exactness before retention changes.
## Next steps
1. Run GPU equivalence probe against V5 dense path:
   - 8 env, seeds 9-16
   - same checkpoint/update2 source
   - same encoded samples to dense and sparse clients
   - compare actions/logProbabilities/values, final state hashes, model/optimizer/RNG diagnostics
2. If exact, integrate sparse retention/replay without changing PPO semantics.
3. Then run full small PPO exactness smoke against V5.
4. Only after exactness PASS, benchmark larger workload.
5. Do not run 50k until the structural path is proven promising.
